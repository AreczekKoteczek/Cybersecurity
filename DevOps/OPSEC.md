# OPSEC
what is opsec, in a nutshell opsec is everything you do to just not get caught

I personally divide opsec into 3 parts
- Info (your identity)
- PC (your computer phone etc.)
- Web (your internet identity)

I chose this division because this is the most common way to recognise you. If you hide these 3 things, you remain practically anonymous on the internet.
